# New Site Provision Scripts

## Site Provisioning

Beginning VVV 2.0, the provision scripts can be included using a git repo. Refer [here](https://tomjn.com/2017/01/16/whats-new-vvv-2-0/).

In order to save myself some time, when I ever I create new sites using VVV, I've created this repo which I can use to provision sites as per my taste.

Feel free to clone this repo and suit yourself!
